CTA Java project focusing on sorting algorithms

Java project to compare execution times for different sorting algorithms. Each algorithm has its own class:
  * BubbleSort.java
  * CountingSort.java
  * InsertionSort.java
  * MergeSort.java
  * InsertionSort.java

A CsvWriter.java class reads from a csv file and outputs the results to the console

A TestRunner.java class contains the main method from where the different algorithms can be run, one at a time - commenting out 4 unused classes. 
A random array method is used to generate arrays of size 100, 250, 500, 1000, 1750, 2500, 5000, 7500 and 10000 to test the effectiveness of each algorithm on the different set sizes.
The algorithm is run 10 times for each set size and an average execution time is returned
